# The "Velkommen" project

This directory contains sketches and final prototypes from a User-Centered Design project I recently finished at the Department of Informatics at the University of Oslo. I designed two separate products/solutions for international students in Oslo based on my findings in multiple interviews and evaluations with users in my target demographic:

## The Figma app prototype
Through my interviews, I discovered that one of the major challenges for new international students arriving in Oslo was simply getting information about what to do and where to go. One possible solution was the "Velkommen" app, an app where you can scroll through "activity cards" and see a selection of offers and events catered to international students. More photos can be found in the **figma_prototype** folder. The full Figma prototype with flow functionality can be seen here: https://www.figma.com/proto/aXdIQ0A77KkpDtiDhvywjs/Prototype-2?node-id=87%3A84&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=3%3A201&show-proto-sidebar=1.

The customer data collection part of this design project is bound by anonymity and data protection principles that are important in our student projects at the University of Oslo, so any further information pertaining to my interviewees or their expressed views, opionions, needs, and requirements will not be made publicly availble.
